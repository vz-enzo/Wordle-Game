# Wordle-Game (Java)
Hey there ;) This is my Java-based Wordle game, a fun little project I built to practice Java and mess around with file handling, loops, and logic. It plays like the real Wordle guess a 5-letter word in 6 tries, and you'll get color-coded feedback:

ðŸŸ© Green = Correct letter in the right spot
ðŸŸ¨ Yellow = Correct letter, wrong spot
ðŸŸ¥ Red = Not in the word at all

src/ â†’ Contains all Java source code
dictionary.txt & answers.txt â†’ List of valid words and Wordle answers
README.md â†’ This file
.gitignore â†’ Keeps unnecessary files out of the repo

How to play?
1. Clone this repo and navigate into the folder:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/WordleGame-Java.git
cd WordleGame-Java

2. Compile the Java files:
javac src/*.java

3. Run the game:
java src.Main

4. Pick a puzzle number (0-2315)
5. Enter a 5-letter word guess
6. See the feedback and keep guessing until you solve it (or run out of tries)

ðŸ›  Features
2,315 different word puzzles
* Checks if your guess is a valid dictionary word
* Color-coded feedback for each letter
